  This is a template audio project for custom battle individual vocalisation audio.

  This is a template audio project for custom battle individual vocalisation audio. 
  Vanilla uses several different names for vocalisation audio: Battle_Individual_Vocalisation, Battle_Ind_Vocalisation, Battle_Ind_Vo, but they all work the same.
  For standardisation all templates for these type of sounds follow the "Battle_Individual" convention.

  Example Events:
  - Battle_Individual_Vocalisation_Belakor_idle_grunt
  - Battle_Ind_Vocalisation_Rot_Fly_Idle

  Below is an explanation of the fields used in this project's configuration:
  - BnkName: This is the name of the bnk. The bnk name in this tempalte should start with the name of the vanilla bnk "campaign_advice__", the rest of the bnk name can be custom.
  - Language: This is the language folder that you want the project to output to.
  - EventName: This is the name of the event. Event names in this template should start with "Battle_Individual_Vocalisation_", the rest of the event name can be custom.
  - Mixer: The mixer determines how the sound will be played in game. In this template the mixer should be "vocalisation".
  - Sounds: Define the path to your sound files here. If multiple sound files are specified a random sound is played each time the event is triggered.
