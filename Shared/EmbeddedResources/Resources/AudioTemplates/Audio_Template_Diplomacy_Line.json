  This is a template audio project for custom diplomacy line audio. There are two types of diplomacy lines, this tempalate covers what plays alongside the speech bubble of text next to characters.

  Example Events:
  - Play_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Pos_01
  - Play_EMP_KF_Dip_Emp_Greet_Neg_02

  Below is an explanation of the fields used in this project's configuration:
  - BnkName: This is the name of the bnk. The bnk name in this tempalte should start with the name of the vanilla bnk "campaign_diplomacy__", the rest of the bnk name can be custom.
  - Language: This is the language folder that you want the project to output to.
  - EventName: This is the name of the event. Event names in this template should start with "Play_", the rest of the event name can be custom.
  - Mixer: The mixer determines how the sound will be played in game. In this template the mixer should be "diplomacy_line".
  - Sounds: Define the path to your sound files here. If multiple sound files are specified a random sound is played each time the event is triggered.
