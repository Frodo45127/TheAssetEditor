// Example Event: IND_Magic_Imrik_Dragon_Horn_Blow

/* 
  ================= README =================
  This is a template audio project for custom ability audio. Vanilla uses several different names for ability audio: Battle_Individual_Ability, Battle_IND_Ability, IND_Ability, but they all work the same.
  For standardisation all templates for these type of sounds follow the "Battle_Individual" convention.

  Example Events:
  - Battle_Individual_Ability_Storm_Dragon_Human_To_Dragon_Pre_Life
  - Battle_IND_Ability_Mislead_Summon

  Below is an explanation of the fields used in this project's configuration:
  - BnkName: This is the name of the bnk. The bnk name in this tempalte should start with the name of the vanilla bnk "battle_individual_magic__", the rest of the bnk name can be custom.
  - Language: This is the language folder that you want the project to output to.
  - EventName: This is the name of the event. Event names in this template should start with "Battle_Individual_Ability_", the rest of the event name can be custom.
  - Mixer: The mixer determines how the sound will be played in game. In this template the mixer should be "ability".
  - Sounds: Define the path to your sound files here. If multiple sound files are specified a random sound is played each time the event is triggered.
