/* 
  ================= README =================
  This is a template audio project for custom UI audio for campaign and battle. Vanilla uses different names for campaign and battle audio: UI_CAM, UI_BAT respectively. 
  For standardisation it's recommended you follow that vanilla naming convention.

  Example Events:
  - UI_CAM_ANI_Sotek_Sacrifice_Performed
  - UI_BAT_SABL_Terrorgheist_Skull_Enable

  Below is an explanation of the fields used in this project's configuration:
  - BnkName: This is the name of the bnk. The bnk name in this tempalte should start with the name of the vanilla bnk "global_ui__", the rest of the bnk name can be custom.
  - Language: This is the language folder that you want the project to output to.
  - EventName: This is the name of the event. Event names in this template should start with "UI_", the rest of the event name can be custom.
  - Mixer: The mixer determines how the sound will be played in game. In this template the mixer should be "ui".
  - Sounds: Define the path to your sound files here. If multiple sound files are specified a random sound is played each time the event is triggered.
